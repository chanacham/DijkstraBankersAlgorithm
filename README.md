# DijkstraBankersAlgorithm
# This program was built during my Operating Systems course. 
# Implements the Dijkstras Algorithm for Deadlock Avoidance.
# A safe system means no deadlock, unsafe means potential deadlock. 
# Checks if granting a resource request will send the system into an unsafe state. 
# Only requests that maintain a safe state will be granted.
